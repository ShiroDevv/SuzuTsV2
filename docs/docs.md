# Suzu Docs
## Docs info
These docs are meant for people who want to work on the bot.
## Info :
The docs will not cover how to make a command, since you can use my libraries (shirojs) InteractionCommandBuilder to make the commands.<br>
I also will not cover current commands since its already in and not usable in other ways, but if you want to see how they work just look at the code

## Documented functions
![logTable](./bot/logTable.md)<br>
![SetupSuzu](./bot/Suzu/suzuSetup.md)
